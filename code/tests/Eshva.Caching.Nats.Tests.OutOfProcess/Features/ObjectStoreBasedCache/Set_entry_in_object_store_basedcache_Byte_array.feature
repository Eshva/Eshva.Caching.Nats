Feature: Set entry in object-store based cache. Byte array

  Background:
    Given expired entries purging interval 2 minutes
    And default sliding expiration interval 1 minutes
    And object-store based cache with synchronous purge
    And entry with key 'existing' and value 'existing value' which expires in 3 minutes put into cache
    And entry with key 'will be removed' and value 'will be removed value' which expires in 1 minutes put into cache

  Scenario: 01. Set a new cache entry asynchronosly with sliding expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array asynchronously 'new' cache entry with value 'some value' and sliding expiration in 5 minutes
    Then 'new' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'new' entry should be expired today at 00:07

  Scenario: 02. Set a new cache entry synchronosly with sliding expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array synchronously 'new' cache entry with value 'some value' and sliding expiration in 5 minutes
    Then 'new' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'new' entry should be expired today at 00:07

  Scenario: 03. Set a new cache entry asynchronosly with absolute expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array asynchronously 'new' cache entry with value 'some value' and absolute expiration at today at 00:30
    Then 'new' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'new' entry should be expired today at 00:30

  Scenario: 04. Set a new cache entry synchronosly with absolute expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array synchronously 'new' cache entry with value 'some value' and absolute expiration at today at 00:30
    Then 'new' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'new' entry should be expired today at 00:30

  Scenario: 05. Set a new cache entry asynchronosly with absolute expiration relative to now
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array asynchronously 'new' cache entry with value 'some value' and absolute expiration 00:30 relative to now
    Then 'new' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'new' entry should be expired today at 00:32

  Scenario: 06. Set a new cache entry synchronosly with absolute expiration relative to now
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array synchronously 'new' cache entry with value 'some value' and absolute expiration 00:30 relative to now
    Then 'new' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'new' entry should be expired today at 00:32

  Scenario: 07. Set a new cache entry asynchronosly with absolute and sliding expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array asynchronously 'new' cache entry with value 'some value' and absolute expiration at today at 00:30 and sliding expiration in 5 minutes
    Then 'new' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'new' entry should be expired today at 00:07

  Scenario: 08. Set a new cache entry synchronosly with absolute and sliding expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array synchronously 'new' cache entry with value 'some value' and absolute expiration at today at 00:30 and sliding expiration in 5 minutes
    Then 'new' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'new' entry should be expired today at 00:07

  Scenario: 09. Set an existing cache entry asynchronosly with sliding expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array asynchronously 'existing' cache entry with value 'some value' and sliding expiration in 5 minutes
    Then 'existing' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'existing' entry should be expired today at 00:07

  Scenario: 10. Set a new cache entry synchronosly with sliding expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array synchronously 'existing' cache entry with value 'some value' and sliding expiration in 5 minutes
    Then 'existing' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'existing' entry should be expired today at 00:07

  Scenario: 11. Set an existing cache entry asynchronosly with absolute expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array asynchronously 'existing' cache entry with value 'some value' and absolute expiration at today at 00:30
    Then 'existing' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'existing' entry should be expired today at 00:30

  Scenario: 12. Set a new cache entry synchronosly with absolute expiration
    Given time passed by 2 minutes
    When I set using byte array synchronously 'existing' cache entry with value 'some value' and absolute expiration at today at 00:30
    Then 'existing' entry is present in the object-store bucket
    And 'will be removed' entry is not present in the object-store bucket
    And 'existing' entry should be expired today at 00:30

  Scenario: 13. Set an existing cache entry asynchronosly with absolute and sliding expiration
